# Linear-Regression-for-Degree-based-Topological-Indices-of-HAM

###Abstract
Topological descriptors are mathematical representations of the molecular structure of chemical compounds and it has seen extensive use in the fields of 
computational biology, cheminformatics, and biomedicine. Since the statistical predicting techniques for molecular properties are economical, 
computing topological descriptors of molecular compounds allows one to comprehend the characteristics and functions of chemical substances.
Recent reports show the conjugate between hyaluronic acid and methotrexate $(HAM)_{\eta}$, shows potential for targeted drug delivery, aiming to improve treatment efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity in conditions like cancer and inflammatory diseases.
This research examines 14 types of open and closed neighbourhood degree sum-based topological indices of $(HAM)_{\eta}$ conjugate.
Results show that regardless of the complex structure of $(HAM)_{\eta}$, each index increases linearly at a different gradient as the conjugate number $(\eta)$ increases. Notably, the second Zagreb $M_{2N}$ and $ND_{3}$ clearly show its discriminative capacity with the highest gradient for both cases.
